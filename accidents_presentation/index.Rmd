## Introduction

This presentation is made as part of the Coursera Developing Data Products Course Project.  The objectives of the assignment are to ensure a sound understanding of the following concepts:

* To build a Data Product Application using the Shiny Package
* To produce a Reproducible Pitch Presentation based on the Data Product

## The Application

The Road Traffic Accidents Application provides the user with an interface to explore and visualise road traffic accidents that occured in York, UK between 2005 and 2014.

The application allows the user to see on a map where to accidents occured, aw well as find out details about the accident by clicking on their placeholder.  Placeholders are colour coded to help the user to see at a glance if the accident had a fatal, serious or slight outcome.

Users are able filter the information via the right hand menu and able to zoom in and out of the map as well as move it around to better understand the results.

The application is available at: [https://sebity.shinyapps.io/road-safety-accidents-york/](https://sebity.shinyapps.io/road-safety-accidents-york/)

## Example Density Map

```{r echo = FALSE}
accidents_rt <- accidents %>%
    filter(Road_Type == 3)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
map <- get_map(location = "UK, York",zoom=12,maptype="roadmap",color="bw")
p <- ggmap(map)
p <- p + stat_density2d(data=accidents_rt, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude,
    fill= ..level.., alpha=..level..), size=5, bins=8, geom="polygon")
print(p)
```
